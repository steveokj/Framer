| 159b1ed0813d5583592b999d5ce9130ba1c0678e | Update web pages to default API port 8001 | video stream failed...i changed default port to 8001 | Updated the web pages to default to `http://localhost:8001` when `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE` isn't set, so the MKV/video views now hit your new FastAPI port. This updates the fallback API base strings and error copy in `web/app/video_frame_mkv/page.tsx` and the other video-related pages under `web/app/`. Tests not run (not requested).<br>Next steps:<br>1) restart `npm run dev` and reload the page.<br>2) confirm the FastAPI server is running on 8001 (or set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE`). | 2026-01-04 14:28:05 |
| f38848f6fc72cce75c0c8f6904f9f12c97bbfe5b | Add upload and server browse tools | any folder. its just for me personally and i can adjust later. it will remember the last used folder on windows 11 right? | Added an upload picker (with optional ingest) and a server-side file browser so you can load videos from phone uploads or pick existing PC files, and widened FastAPI file roots so absolute paths stream outside the repo.<br>- Upload + ingest toggle and server browser UI: `web/app/video_frame_mkv/page.tsx`, `web/app/video_mkv/page.tsx`.<br>- Upload handler: `web/app/api/mkv_upload/route.ts` (saves to `data/uploads`, optional `cli/mkv_ingest.py` run).<br>- Server browser: `web/app/api/server_browse/route.ts` (remembers last folder in localStorage); Windows file picker itself usually remembers the last folder per site on Windows 11.<br>- File serving roots: `server.py` now includes local drives; can be overridden with `ALLOWED_FILE_ROOTS` (semicolon-separated).<br>Next steps:<br>1) restart FastAPI and `npm run dev`.<br>2) try the upload button or browse server files. | 2026-01-04 16:17:48 |
| d83ccedc713274a87e1640edfd4ab3ff67e67440 | Improve upload progress and ingest feedback | make the uploading ui feedback better. how many left to upload, when ingesting and all, when transcribing..e.t.c | Improved the MKV upload UI to show upload percent, remaining bytes, and live ingest/transcription status with an expandable log. Added an SSE ingest endpoint at `web/app/api/mkv_ingest/route.ts` and wired both `web/app/video_frame_mkv/page.tsx` and `web/app/video_mkv/page.tsx` to stream ingest stages and show transcription state.

| a67fe6ca1a13400ab666923f74c825ccd9fbd094 | Increase mkv ingest SQLite busy timeout | [mkv_ingest] video: C:\Users\steve\Desktop\Framer\data\uploads\IGotThis-mk09xmuq-0a2821.mp4<br>Traceback (most recent call last):<br>File "C:\Users\steve\Desktop\Framer\cli\mkv_ingest.py", line 967, in <module><br>raise SystemExit(main())<br>^^^^^^<br>File "C:\Users\steve\Desktop\Framer\cli\mkv_ingest.py", line 790, in main<br>video_chunk_id = get_or_create_video_chunk(conn, video_path)<br>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>File "C:\Users\steve\Desktop\Framer\cli\mkv_ingest.py", line 463, in get_or_create_video_chunk<br>cur = conn.execute(<br>^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>sqlite3.OperationalError: database is locked | Updated `cli/mkv_ingest.py` to use a longer SQLite timeout and `PRAGMA busy_timeout` so ingest waits longer when another process briefly holds the database lock. This should reduce “database is locked” failures when uploads overlap or another writer is active. Tests not run (not requested). | 2026-01-04 17:02:38 |
| 2b00795576f16cc73c6c129100303cce535791ae | Add ingest progress feedback and metadata gating | [codex-clipboard-Typw0e.png 1442x659] why does it say no vidoe record immediately. and for starting ingest why is it just there. at least it should show how many percent ingested or something | Prevented the “No video record found” error during ingest by deferring metadata fetch until ingest completes, and added frame-based ingest progress (percent + progress bar) from new mkv_ingest log lines. Updates in `cli/mkv_ingest.py`, `web/app/video_frame_mkv/page.tsx`, and `web/app/video_mkv/page.tsx`. Tests not run (not requested). | 2026-01-04 17:28:05 |
| c740572215ff2825cd1b6c217fb4b82a9d49f4fc | Show ingest progress during frame extraction | i should get an ingest progress t00 | Added ffmpeg extraction progress reporting in `cli/mkv_ingest.py` and surfaced it in the UI so ingest progress updates during frame extraction (not just OCR). Also updated the ingest SSE stage detector in `web/app/api/mkv_ingest/route.ts` and both MKV pages to label extraction vs processing with different colors. Tests not run (not requested). | 2026-01-04 17:38:56 |
| 04d266473f8e336de17a3bf3d71c5b0b9ad347ad | Stream ingest logs without buffering | [codex-clipboard-IBgLnI.png 1315x532] you dont understand. it says starting ingesting. am i just supposed to wait. why cant i get a progress on the ingesting | Forced unbuffered Python output and flushed mkv_ingest progress prints so the UI receives extract/frames progress immediately, plus the ingest SSE route now runs Python with `-u` and `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1`. Tests not run (not requested). | 2026-01-04 17:43:02 |
| a0ce3933fe92dbc184922eb062a8698a39aa1007 | Show processing progress immediately and clear stale metadata | [codex-clipboard-IBgLnI.png 1315x532] you dont understand. it says starting ingesting. am i just supposed to wait. why cant i get a progress on the ingesting | Added an immediate `frames: 0/N` progress log when OCR processing starts so the UI shows processing progress right away, and cleared stale metadata on video path changes to prevent showing the previous video's timeline while an ingest is running. Updates in `cli/mkv_ingest.py`, `web/app/video_frame_mkv/page.tsx`, and `web/app/video_mkv/page.tsx`. Tests not run (not requested). | 2026-01-04 17:52:40 |
| 91dfd114698e4d027df71424aaddce8b852b698b | Add fast ingest mode with fps cap | great job. the frames are 2956. and we might have larger videos. what do you suggest? | Added a Fast ingest toggle with a max-fps cap (default 2 fps) so large videos ingest quicker while keeping transcription, and wired the ingest API to pass `--max-fps` and a higher dedup threshold. Updated `cli/mkv_ingest.py`, `web/app/api/mkv_ingest/route.ts`, `web/app/video_frame_mkv/page.tsx`, and `web/app/video_mkv/page.tsx`. Tests not run (not requested). | 2026-01-04 18:09:31 |
| 59867436345396786c0c3d751fcb9c8d8cce78a0 | Add captions toggle and set fast ingest fps default | this is perfect. change default fps to 1. int he current transcript, remove the timestamp [codex-clipboard-ubwbhU.png 1484x205]. fix the view, right now the video size is so big i have to scroll down and down. add a subtite icon between the play icon and restart icon of the video that plays the subtitles on the video itself. just like normal youtube videos | Set fast ingest default to 1 fps, removed timestamp brackets from current transcript display, and added a captions toggle with an on-video subtitle overlay between the play and restart controls. Also constrained the video height to reduce scrolling. Changes in `web/app/api/mkv_ingest/route.ts`, `web/app/video_frame_mkv/page.tsx`, and `web/app/video_mkv/page.tsx`.

| ee9042f787df0556c756d438d78803aa5b6be9a1 | Strip inline transcript timestamps | so good. however, when i seek, i still see some timestamps in the subtitle [codex-clipboard-4TdlYC.png 1767x527] | Updated transcript cleaning to remove timestamp brackets anywhere in the line so subtitles stay clean even after seeking. Change in `web/app/video_frame_mkv/page.tsx`. Tests not run (not requested). | 2026-01-04 18:31:21 |
| b6a752f50e7d2cc5b2cdaf44f3a0ceb9b08839a3 | Add time stone event plan and recorder scaffold | good draft a complete design as EVENT_PLAN.md and begin working. | Added the full design doc in `EVENT_PLAN.md` and scaffolded a Rust CLI stub in `tools/timestone_recorder` for the manual start/stop recorder. Tests not run (not requested). | 2026-01-04 18:45:37 |
| 29d85ddf7cc9799be3dbe36be0ed7e618a01fda1 | Implement timestone recorder hooks and storage | do 1 and 2 | Implemented the SQLite session/event storage plus Windows mouse/keyboard hooks and a 1 Hz snapshot loop in `tools/timestone_recorder`. This includes manual start/stop via a stop signal file, session start/stop events, and basic shortcut logging. Tests not run (not requested). | 2026-01-04 19:01:02 |
